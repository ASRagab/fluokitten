# Learn You a Haskell for Great Good - in Clojure

This tutorial is a Clojure version of the book [Learn You a Haskell for Great Good](http://learnyouahaskell.com). This article is not self-contained: it is ment to be read side-by-side with the [book](http://learnyouahaskell.com), and used as a commentary and reference for the Clojure version of the examples. Due to the differences in typing, data structures, support for varargs and currying, there are differences in how the concepts that the original article explains are implemented in Haskell and Clojure.

It is recommended that you first read the article [Functors, Applicatives, and Monads in Pictures - in Clojure](/articles/functors_applicatives_monads_in_pictures.html) before reading this article.

To be able to follow along, you'll have to have Clojure installed and Fluokitten library included as a dependency in your project, as described in [Getting Started Guide](/articles/getting_started.html). Obviously, you'll need a reasonable knowledge of Clojure (you don't have to be an expert, though), and being familiar with the basics of Haskell is helpful, but not a necessity. So, after checking out [Getting Started Guide](/articles/getting_started.html), start up Clojure REPL and open this article and the [Learn You a Haskell for Great Good](http://learnyouahaskell.com) book side by side and we are ready to go.

The complete source code of the examples used in this article is available [here](https://github.com/uncomplicate/fluokitten/blob/master/test/uncomplicate/fluokitten/articles/learnyouaheaskell.clj) in the form of [midje](https://github.com/marick/Midje) tests.
